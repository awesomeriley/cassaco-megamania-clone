Atari Megamania game clone implemented in C/C++ and SDL.
This should be the first game created by Cassaco Development Team.
We're very proud for this kickoff and we want to share this code with everyone interested in game development.

We may put some JAVA codes too, 'cause we're doing some J2ME Game Projects too. And may the Force be with us!
